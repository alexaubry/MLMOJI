 # Congratulations!

 You now have completed this book. ðŸ’¯

 In this Playground, we have explored an interactive application of machine learning with the [emoji classifier](MLMOJI/Introducing%20MLMOJI),
 and learned more about building a data set from scratch by taking advantage of [data augmentation](MLMOJI/Building%20a%20Data%20Set).

 ## Where to Go Next?

 ---

 If you wish to learn more, reusing the knowledge from this book, there are some related topics and questions worth exploring:

 - What is the structure of a neural network? What is an **activation function**?

 - What are **convolutions** ? Why are they commonly used for image processing?

 - How to train a neural network faster by using another trained model with **transfer learning**?

 - What is **overfitting** and how to prevent it?

 - What are the different machine learning tools?

 - Callout(Thank you for reading! ðŸ“–): I hope this quick introduction to machine learning and image
 classification interested you.
